    <h1> Our Mission </h1>
    <br>
    <p>Our website will focus on pollution and show multiple causes of pollution as well as the many problems in society pollution contributes to. By discussing systems in place and related issues, we hope to highlight pollution’s potency. With the problem, we would like to share solutions as well as companies and organizations that are currently working to counter the effects of climate change and pollution in the city that we love and the planet we call Earth.</p>

    <p>Pollution is a massive issue that we feel a lot of people , if not everyone can connect to as a whole. Pollution is a major contributor to other problems like poor air quality and global warming. It has managed to effect the quality of life of far too many—which inspired us.</p>
